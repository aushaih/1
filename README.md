## apple
So i wanna work in apple for a few reasons 
But of all the things that has really inspired me 
To pursue this opportunity 

Is I’m passionate about the product 
I have been using Apple products for years 

I have had 8 iPhones over the course of my life 
I also love the Apple Watch and i love the way they seamlessly work together 

So working with company where i am passionate about the product to me is something I would love to do

## Customer 
Customer service is the support you offer your customers both befoer and after they buy the products 
or the services you offer to hep them have enjoyable experience with you  

i think that the most important aspect of customer service is satisfying the customer needs 
because thats what will lead the company to progress and have a good reputations 

## Approach
The customer service approach starts with the greeting in addition to a smile and friendly voice. For example:
Hi, my name is Hussain and welcome to apple It is important to introduce yourself and say the store name to the customers. 
This will help them think about where they are and feel welcome


You may have a fantastic product, but if your customer service is unhelpful, unreliable, and you’ll lose customers over it.
That's one big reason why investing in customer service is key to long-term business success.

## Experience
the goal is to create great cusomer experince by turn every interaction we create to enjoyable and satisfying experience

Know your product - Answer with confidence so customer can trust your knowledge of the product, that will take Doubters and turning them to believers
Respond quickly 

Friendly communication - i mean by remove lots of frictions, Listening, understanding your customer's needs,
A happy customer will return often and is likely to spend more. They may also refer other people to your business


## strengths
I have strong communication and analytical skills 
Strong interpersonal And leadership skills and project management 
Whenever I’m working with group i naturally leading the team by assigning tasks and make sure everybody knows what they responsible for

I say that my main strength is my leadership ability 
Which was evidence the way I mentor my sales team to reach the goal 

## weakness
Well I used to have problem with public speaking 
However , in order to overcome this 
I signed up for class in public speaking 
To develop my skill 
During my coursework i was responsible for an audience of at least 30 people on weekly basis and quickly became comfortable doing so 
I started speak at team meeting in my last position which led me to become the leader there 
I’m now able to give presentations to larger groups
And it also made me more confident 


## Pressure
I’m actually at my most productive I’m careful to prioritize tasks and structure ways for me to manage my time 

Usually I create calendar that outlined the time to practice and complete each project in time 
Having it all planned out, allow you to focus and minimize stress 

## Decision
At my previous job We had a company wants to order from us 22 tracks 
But they were insist that we give them Lower Price
Because the Our competitor give them much much lower 
The sales manager was out of the country at our last meeting with the company
So i give them the best Price that we allowed to in our price range
And get them back in track 
And I close a deal with them
And after that they come back and buy from us 30 tracks
And every 4 -6 months they buy from us again 
The company becomes one of the key account that we have 

## Problem
Customer service was receiving a significant number of complaints about stock arriving way too late.
I reviewed our delivery schedule then met with the staff involved in the customer delivery process.
We identified that the problem seemed to be that the orders for stock were not being processed fast enough.
I recommended a change in our data entry system and regular follow-up with customers was added to the process.
This solved the late delay problem and ensured customers felt their needs


## Proud
'm most proud of the Marketing I designed and launched in Zain company,
They had great package’s which is called Double 
I designed marketing brochure for the package and translated it in more than 4 languages 
And we had great success and sales 
And not just me or my store I worked in
This affects other branch's we had many customers asking about the package that they saw

And I took the best employee of the month 

This experience taught me the value of hard work and teamwork as well

## Rejection
Rejection is part of the work process. You will get push back and rejection at some point 
One trick I learned early on in my sales career is to send a proposal, either way you never know what will happen . 
Perhaps my competition gained the clients' , And it works before 
So, I never take the first-time rejection as a final answer."


## Bad 
I would i ask him about the situation 
If we get the job done right and if he agreed or not ,, We don’t want to bother the client
Also we will follow up with the team about this client's account and history and open ticket in the support system
And we can reached out to the client
And know more about it and we want to help and to remind him to provide and honest feedback ,
