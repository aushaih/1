## Customer 
Customer service is the support you offer your customers both befoer and after they buy the products 
or the services you offer to hep them have enjoyable experience with you  

i think that the most important aspect of customer service is satisfying the customer needs 
because thats what will lead the company to progress and have a good reputations 

## Approach
The customer service approach starts with the greeting in addition to a smile and friendly voice. For example:
Hi, my name is Hussain and welcome to apple It is important to introduce yourself and say the store name to the customers. 
This will help them think about where they are and feel welcome


You may have a fantastic product, but if your customer service is unhelpful, unreliable, and you’ll lose customers over it.
That's one big reason why investing in customer service is key to long-term business success.
